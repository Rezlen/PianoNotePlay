React: The Virtual DOM
Fighting Wasteful DOM Manipulation

The Problem
DOM manipulation is the heart of the modern, interactive web. Unfortunately, it is also a lot slower than most JavaScript operations.

This slowness is made worse by the fact that most JavaScript frameworks update the DOM much more than they have to.

As an example, let’s say that you have a list that contains ten items. You check off the first item. Most JavaScript frameworks would rebuild the entire list. That’s ten times more work than necessary! Only one item changed, but the remaining nine get rebuilt exactly how they were before.

Rebuilding a list is no big deal to a web browser, but modern websites can use huge amounts of DOM manipulation. Inefficient updating has become a serious problem.

To address this problem, the people at React popularized something called the virtual DOM.

The Virtual DOM
In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding “virtual DOM object.” A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy.

A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real thing’s power to directly change what’s on the screen.

Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because nothing gets drawn onscreen. Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house.

How it helps
When you render a JSX element, every single virtual DOM object gets updated.

This sounds incredibly inefficient, but the cost is insignificant because the virtual DOM can update so quickly.

Once the virtual DOM has updated, then React compares the virtual DOM with a virtual DOM snapshot that was taken right before the update.

By comparing the new virtual DOM with a pre-update version, React figures out exactly which virtual DOM objects have changed. This process is called “diffing.”

Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then React updates those objects, and only those objects, on the real DOM. In our example from earlier, React would be smart enough to rebuild your one checked-off list-item, and leave the rest of your list alone.

This makes a big difference! React can update only the necessary parts of the DOM. React’s reputation for performance comes largely from this innovation.

In summary, here’s what happens when you try to update the DOM in React:

The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React figures out which objects have changed.
The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.
Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.
If you’d like to learn more about the virtual DOM, here’s a good place to start.

=======================
Why React?
React.js is a JavaScript library. It was developed by engineers at Facebook.

Here are just a few of the reasons why people choose to program with React:

React is fast. Apps made in React can handle complex updates and still feel quick and responsive.

React is modular. Instead of writing large, dense files of code, you can write many smaller, reusable files. React’s modularity can be a beautiful solution to JavaScript’s maintainability problems.

React is scalable. Large programs that display a lot of changing data are where React performs best.

React is flexible. You can use React for interesting projects that have nothing to do with making a web app. People are still figuring out React’s potential. There’s room to explore.

React is popular. While this reason has admittedly little to do with React’s quality, the truth is that understanding React will make you more employable.

If you are new to React, then this course is for you! No prior React knowledge is expected. We will start at the very beginning and move slowly.

If you are new to JavaScript, then consider taking our JavaScript course and then returning to React.

The Codecademy React courses are not a high-level overview. They are a deep dive. Take your time! By the end, you will be ready to program in React with a real understanding of what you’re doing

================
const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
Does this code belong in a JavaScript file, an HTML file, or somewhere else?
The answer is…a JavaScript file! Despite what it looks like, your code doesn’t actually contain any HTML at all.
The part that looks like HTML, <h1>Hello world</h1>, is something called JSX.
Click Next to learn about JSX.

What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML.

What does “syntax extension” mean?

In this case, it means that JSX is not valid JavaScript. Web browsers can’t read it!

If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be compiled. That means that before the file reaches a web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.

Codecademy’s servers already have a JSX compiler installed, so you don’t have to worry about that for now. Eventually we’ll walk through how to set up a JSX compiler on your personal computer.
===================
JSX Elements
A basic unit of JSX is called a JSX element.

Here’s an example of a JSX element:

<h1>Hello world</h1>
This JSX element looks exactly like HTML! The only noticeable difference is that you would find it in a JavaScript file, instead of in an HTML file.
==============
INTRO TO JSX
JSX Elements And Their Surroundings
JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions. They can go anywhere that JavaScript expressions can go.

That means that a JSX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or array…you name it.

Here’s an example of a JSX element being saved in a variable:

const navBar = <nav>I am a nav bar</nav>;
Here’s an example of several JSX elements being stored in an object:

const myTeam = {
  center: <li>Benzo Walli</li>,
  powerForward: <li>Rasha Loa</li>,
  smallForward: <li>Tayshaun Dasmoto</li>,
  shootingGuard: <li>Colmar Cumberbatch</li>,
  pointGuard: <li>Femi Billon</li>
};
==================
Attributes In JSX
JSX elements can have attributes, just like HTML elements can.

A JSX attribute is written using HTML-like syntax: a name, followed by an equals sign, followed by a value. The value should be wrapped in quotes, like this:

my-attribute-name="my-attribute-value"
Here are some JSX elements with attributes:

<a href='http://www.example.com'>Welcome to the Web</a>;
 
const title = <h1 id='title'>Introduction to React.js: Part I</h1>; 
A single JSX element can have many attributes, just like in HTML:

const panda = <img src='images/panda.jpg' alt='panda' width='500px' height='500px' />;
-=================

Nested JSX
You can nest JSX elements inside of other JSX elements, just like in HTML.

Here’s an example of a JSX <h1> element, nested inside of a JSX <a> element:

<a href="https://www.example.com"><h1>Click me!</h1></a>
To make this more readable, you can use HTML-style line breaks and indentation:

<a href="https://www.example.com">
  <h1>
    Click me!
  </h1>
</a>
If a JSX expression takes up more than one line, then you must wrap the multi-line JSX expression in parentheses. This looks strange at first, but you get used to it:

(
  <a href="https://www.example.com">
    <h1>
      Click me!
    </h1>
  </a>
)
Nested JSX expressions can be saved as variables, passed to functions, etc., just like non-nested JSX expressions can! Here’s an example of a nested JSX expression being saved as a variable:

 const theExample = (
   <a href="https://www.example.com">
     <h1>
       Click me!
     </h1>
   </a>
 );
 ====================
 JSX Outer Elements
There’s a rule that we haven’t mentioned: a JSX expression must have exactly one outermost element.

In other words, this code will work:

const paragraphs = (
  <div id="i-am-the-outermost-element">
    <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
    <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
);
But this code will not work:

const paragraphs = (
  <p>I am a paragraph.</p> 
  <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
);
The first opening tag and the final closing tag of a JSX expression must belong to the same JSX element!

It’s easy to forget about this rule, and end up with errors that are tough to diagnose.

If you notice that a JSX expression has multiple outer elements, the solution is usually simple: wrap the JSX expression in a <div></div>.
==================
To render a JSX expression means to make it appear onscreen.
================

ReactDOM.render() I
Let’s examine the code that you just wrote. Start in previous.js, on line 5, all the way to the left.

You can see something called ReactDOM. What’s that?

ReactDOM is the name of a JavaScript library. This library contains several React-specific methods, all of which deal with the DOM in some way or another.

We’ll talk more later about how ReactDOM got into your file. For now, just understand that it’s yours to use.

Move slightly to the right, and you can see one of ReactDOM‘s methods: ReactDOM.render().

ReactDOM.render() is the most common way to render JSX. It takes a JSX expression, creates a corresponding tree of DOM nodes, and adds that tree to the DOM. That is the way to make a JSX expression appear onscreen.

Move to the right a little more, and you come to this expression:

<h1>Hello world</h1>
This is the first argument being passed to ReactDOM.render(). ReactDOM.render()‘s first argument should be a JSX expression, and it will be rendered to the screen.

We’ll discuss the second argument in the next exercise!
=================

ADVANCED JSX
class vs className
This lesson will cover more advanced JSX. You’ll learn some powerful tricks, and some common errors to avoid.

Grammar in JSX is mostly the same as in HTML, but there are subtle differences to watch out for. Probably the most frequent of these involves the word class.

In HTML, it’s common to use class as an attribute name:

<h1 class="big">Hey</h1>
In JSX, you can’t use the word class! You have to use className instead:

<h1 className="big">Hey</h1>
This is because JSX gets translated into JavaScript, and class is a reserved word in JavaScript.

When JSX is rendered, JSX className attributes are automatically rendered as class attributes.
-------------------------
Curly Braces in JSX
The code in the last exercise didn’t behave as one might expect. Instead of adding 2 and 3, it printed out “2 + 3” as a string of text. Why?

This happened because 2 + 3 is located in between <h1> and </h1> tags.

Any code in between the tags of a JSX element will be read as JSX, not as regular JavaScript! JSX doesn’t add numbers - it reads them as text, just like HTML.

You need a way to write code that says, “Even though I am located in between JSX tags, treat me like ordinary JavaScript and not like JSX.”

You can do this by wrapping your code in curly braces.

ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>{2 + 3}</h1>,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
outcome; 5
==================
Variables in JSX
When you inject JavaScript into JSX, that JavaScript is part of the same environment as the rest of the JavaScript in your file.

That means that you can access variables while inside of a JSX expression, even if those variables were declared on the outside.

// Declare a variable:
const name = 'Gerdo';
 
// Access your variable 
// from inside of a JSX expression:
const greeting = <p>Hello, {name}!</p>;
============
Variable Attributes in JSX
When writing JSX, it’s common to use variables to set attributes.

Here’s an example of how that might work:

// Use a variable to set the `height` and `width` attributes:
 
const sideLength = "200px";
 
const panda = (
  <img 
    src="images/panda.jpg" 
    alt="panda" 
    height={sideLength} 
    width={sideLength} />
);
Notice how in this example, the <img />‘s attributes each get their own line. 
This can make your code more readable if you have a lot of attributes on one element.

Object properties are also often used to set attributes:

const pics = {
  panda: "http://bit.ly/1Tqltv5",
  owl: "http://bit.ly/1XGtkM3",
  owlCat: "http://bit.ly/1Upbczi"
}; 
 
const panda = (
  <img 
    src={pics.panda} 
    alt="Lazy Panda" />
);
 
const owl = (
  <img 
    src={pics.owl} 
    alt="Unimpressed Owl" />
);
 
const owlCat = (
  <img 
    src={pics.owlCat} 
    alt="Ghastly Abomination" />
); 
=================

Event Listeners in JSX
JSX elements can have event listeners, just like HTML elements can. Programming in React means constantly working with event listeners.

You create an event listener by giving a JSX element a special attribute. Here’s an example:

<img onClick={myFunc} />
An event listener attribute’s name should be something like onClick or onMouseOver: the word on, plus the type of event that you’re listening for. You can see a list of valid event names here.

An event listener attribute’s value should be a function. The above example would only work if myFunc were a valid function that had been defined elsewhere:

function myFunc() {
  alert('Make myFunc the pFunc... omg that was horrible i am so sorry');
}
 
<img onClick={myFunc} />
Note that in HTML, event listener names are written in all lowercase, such as onclick or onmouseover. In JSX, event listener names are written in camelCase, such as onClick or onMouseOver.
======================

JSX Conditionals: If Statements That Do Work
How can you write a conditional, if you can’t inject an if statement into JSX?

Well, one option is to write an if statement, and not inject it into JSX.

Look at if.js. Follow the if statement, all the way from line 6 down to line 18.

if.js works, because the words if and else are not injected in between JSX tags. The if statement is on the outside, and no JavaScript injection is necessary.

This is a common way to express conditionals in JSX.

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

let message;

if (user.age >= drinkingAge) {
  message = (
    <h1>
      Hey, check out this alcoholic beverage!
    </h1>
  );
} else {
  message = (
    <h1>
      Hey, check out these earrings I got at Claire's!
    </h1>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  message, 
  document.getElementById('app')
);
-------------------------import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function coinToss() {
  // This function will randomly return either 'heads' or 'tails'.
  return Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails';
}

const pics = {
  kitty: 'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-kitty.jpg',
  doggy: 'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-puppy.jpeg'
};
let img;

// if/else statement begins here:
if (coinToss() === 'heads') {
  img = (<img src={pics.kitty} />)

} else {
    img = (<img src={pics.doggy} />)
}

ReactDOM.render(img, document.getElementById('app'))



================
JSX Conditionals: The Ternary Operator
There’s a more compact way to write conditionals in JSX: the ternary operator.

The ternary operator works the same way in React as it does in regular JavaScript. However, it shows up in React surprisingly often.

Recall how it works: you write x ? y : z, where x, y, and z are all JavaScript expressions. When your code is executed, x is evaluated as either “truthy” or “falsy.” If x is truthy, then the entire ternary operator returns y. If x is falsy, then the entire ternary operator returns z. Here’s a nice explanation if you need a refresher.

Here’s how you might use the ternary operator in a JSX expression:

const headline = (
  <h1>
    { age >= drinkingAge ? 'Buy Drink' : 'Do Teen Stuff' }
  </h1>
);
In the above example, if age is greater than or equal to drinkingAge, then headline will equal <h1>Buy Drink</h1>. Otherwise, headline will equal <h1>Do Teen Stuff</h1>.
-------------------------
const img = <img src={pics[coinToss() === 'heads' ? 'kitty' : 'doggy']} />;

=====================

JSX Conditionals: &&
We’re going to cover one final way of writing conditionals in React: the && operator.

Like the ternary operator, && is not React-specific, but it shows up in React surprisingly often.

In the last two lessons, you wrote statements that would sometimes render a kitty and other times render a doggy. && would not have been the best choice for those lessons.

&& works best in conditionals that will sometimes do an action, but other times do nothing at all.

Here’s an example:

const tasty = (
  <ul>
    <li>Applesauce</li>
    { !baby && <li>Pizza</li> }
    { age > 15 && <li>Brussels Sprouts</li> }
    { age > 20 && <li>Oysters</li> }
    { age > 25 && <li>Grappa</li> }
  </ul>
);
If the expression on the left of the && evaluates as true, then the JSX on the right of the && will be rendered. If the first expression is false, however, then the JSX to the right of the && will be ignored and not rendered.

================
.map in JSX
The array method .map() comes up often in React. It’s good to get in the habit of using it alongside JSX.

If you want to create a list of JSX elements, then .map() is often your best bet. It can look odd at first:

const strings = ['Home', 'Shop', 'About Me'];
 
const listItems = strings.map(string => <li>{string}</li>);
 
<ul>{listItems}</ul>
In the above example, we start out with an array of strings. We call .map() on this array of strings, and the .map() call returns a new array of <li>s.

On the last line of the example, note that {listItems} will evaluate to an array, because it’s the returned value of .map()! JSX <li>s don’t have to be in an array like this, but they can be.

// This is fine in JSX, not in an explicit array:
 
<ul>
  <li>item 1</li>
  <li>item 2</li>
  <li>item 3</li>
</ul>
 
// This is also fine!
 
const liArray = [
  <li>item 1</li>, 
  <li>item 2</li>, 
  <li>item 3</li>
];
 
<ul>{liArray}</ul>
==================

Keys
When you make a list in JSX, sometimes your list will need to include something called keys:

<ul>
  <li key="li-01">Example1</li>
  <li key="li-02">Example2</li>
  <li key="li-03">Example3</li>
</ul>
A key is a JSX attribute. The attribute’s name is key. The attribute’s value should be something unique, similar to an id attribute.

keys don’t do anything that you can see! React uses them internally to keep track of lists. If you don’t use keys when you’re supposed to, React might accidentally scramble your list-items into the wrong order.

Not all lists need to have keys. A list needs keys if either of the following are true:

The list-items have memory from one render to the next. For instance, when a to-do list renders, each item must “remember” whether it was checked off. The items shouldn’t get amnesia when they render.

A list’s order might be shuffled. For instance, a list of search results might be shuffled from one render to the next.

If neither of these conditions are true, then you don’t have to worry about keys. If you aren’t sure then it never hurts to use them!
-------------------------
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const people = ['Rowe', 'Prevost', 'Gare'];

const peopleLis = people.map((person, i) => 
  <li key={'person_' + i}>{person}</li>
  );
  // expression goes here:



// ReactDOM.render goes here:
ReactDOM.render(<ul>{peopleLis}</ul>, document.getElementById('app'));
==================

React.createElement
You can write React code without using JSX at all!

The majority of React programmers do use JSX, and we will use it for the remainder of this tutorial, but you should understand that it is possible to write React code without it.

The following JSX expression:

const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
can be rewritten without JSX, like this:

const h1 = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  null,
  "Hello world"
);
When a JSX element is compiled, the compiler transforms the JSX element into the method that you see above: React.createElement(). Every JSX element is secretly a call to React.createElement().

We won’t go in-depth into how React.createElement() works, but you can start with the documentation if you’d like to learn more!
