React: The Virtual DOM
Fighting Wasteful DOM Manipulation

The Problem
DOM manipulation is the heart of the modern, interactive web. Unfortunately, it is also a lot slower than most JavaScript operations.

This slowness is made worse by the fact that most JavaScript frameworks update the DOM much more than they have to.

As an example, let’s say that you have a list that contains ten items. You check off the first item. Most JavaScript frameworks would rebuild the entire list. That’s ten times more work than necessary! Only one item changed, but the remaining nine get rebuilt exactly how they were before.

Rebuilding a list is no big deal to a web browser, but modern websites can use huge amounts of DOM manipulation. Inefficient updating has become a serious problem.

To address this problem, the people at React popularized something called the virtual DOM.

The Virtual DOM
In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding “virtual DOM object.” A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy.

A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real thing’s power to directly change what’s on the screen.

Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because nothing gets drawn onscreen. Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house.

How it helps
When you render a JSX element, every single virtual DOM object gets updated.

This sounds incredibly inefficient, but the cost is insignificant because the virtual DOM can update so quickly.

Once the virtual DOM has updated, then React compares the virtual DOM with a virtual DOM snapshot that was taken right before the update.

By comparing the new virtual DOM with a pre-update version, React figures out exactly which virtual DOM objects have changed. This process is called “diffing.”

Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then React updates those objects, and only those objects, on the real DOM. In our example from earlier, React would be smart enough to rebuild your one checked-off list-item, and leave the rest of your list alone.

This makes a big difference! React can update only the necessary parts of the DOM. React’s reputation for performance comes largely from this innovation.

In summary, here’s what happens when you try to update the DOM in React:

The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React figures out which objects have changed.
The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.
Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.
If you’d like to learn more about the virtual DOM, here’s a good place to start.

=======================
Why React?
React.js is a JavaScript library. It was developed by engineers at Facebook.

Here are just a few of the reasons why people choose to program with React:

React is fast. Apps made in React can handle complex updates and still feel quick and responsive.

React is modular. Instead of writing large, dense files of code, you can write many smaller, reusable files. React’s modularity can be a beautiful solution to JavaScript’s maintainability problems.

React is scalable. Large programs that display a lot of changing data are where React performs best.

React is flexible. You can use React for interesting projects that have nothing to do with making a web app. People are still figuring out React’s potential. There’s room to explore.

React is popular. While this reason has admittedly little to do with React’s quality, the truth is that understanding React will make you more employable.

If you are new to React, then this course is for you! No prior React knowledge is expected. We will start at the very beginning and move slowly.

If you are new to JavaScript, then consider taking our JavaScript course and then returning to React.

The Codecademy React courses are not a high-level overview. They are a deep dive. Take your time! By the end, you will be ready to program in React with a real understanding of what you’re doing

================
const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
Does this code belong in a JavaScript file, an HTML file, or somewhere else?
The answer is…a JavaScript file! Despite what it looks like, your code doesn’t actually contain any HTML at all.
The part that looks like HTML, <h1>Hello world</h1>, is something called JSX.

What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML.

What does “syntax extension” mean?

In this case, it means that JSX is not valid JavaScript. Web browsers can’t read it!

If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be compiled. That means that before the file reaches a web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.

Codecademy’s servers already have a JSX compiler installed, so you don’t have to worry about that for now. Eventually we’ll walk through how to set up a JSX compiler on your personal computer.
===================
JSX Elements
A basic unit of JSX is called a JSX element.

Here’s an example of a JSX element:

<h1>Hello world</h1>
This JSX element looks exactly like HTML! The only noticeable difference is that you would find it in a JavaScript file, instead of in an HTML file.
==============
INTRO TO JSX
JSX Elements And Their Surroundings
JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions. They can go anywhere that JavaScript expressions can go.

That means that a JSX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or array…you name it.

Here’s an example of a JSX element being saved in a variable:

const navBar = <nav>I am a nav bar</nav>;
Here’s an example of several JSX elements being stored in an object:

const myTeam = {
  center: <li>Benzo Walli</li>,
  powerForward: <li>Rasha Loa</li>,
  smallForward: <li>Tayshaun Dasmoto</li>,
  shootingGuard: <li>Colmar Cumberbatch</li>,
  pointGuard: <li>Femi Billon</li>
};
