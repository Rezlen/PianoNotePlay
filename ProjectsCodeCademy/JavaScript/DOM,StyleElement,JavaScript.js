﻿JAVASCRIPT AND THE DOM
Style an Element
Another way to modify an element is by changing its CSS style. 
The .style property of a DOM element provides access to the inline style of that HTML tag.

The syntax follows an element.style.property format, with the property representing a CSS property. 
For example, the following code selects the first element with a class of blue and assigns blue as the background-color:

let blueElement = document.querySelector('.blue');
blueElement.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
Unlike CSS, the DOM .style property does not implement a hyphen such as background-color, but rather camel case notation, backgroundColor. 
Check out this MDN reference page to see a list of how CSS properties are converted into JavaScript.

The following chaining syntax would also work:

document.querySelector('.blue').style.fontFamily = 'Roboto';
