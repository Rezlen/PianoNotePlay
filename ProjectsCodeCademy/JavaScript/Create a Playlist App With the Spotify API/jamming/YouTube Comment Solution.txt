It took me a while, after finishing step 95, to actually get this to work. 

My major fixes were:
- Adding an onClick attribute in the search bar's <button> element. The onClick should equal to {this.search}. (See Muhammad's original comment below.)
- Running by my inconsistent naming of variables, notably I was writing trackURIs, but also writing trackUris (These mistakes stem from the walkthrough video applying all caps to URI, but not all caps to the likes of Id and Url)
- Double-checking the redirect URL's added into Spotify.js for the syntactically  correct `${variable}` implementations.

Side-note; from step 29 onward I had this walk-through video carry me through the whole exercise
Side-note2; it still takes 3 seach button clicks to actually get search results to show
