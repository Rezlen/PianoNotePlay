//Defer attribute
When the HTML parser comes across a <script> element, it stops to load its content. Once loaded, the JavaScript code is executed and the HTML parser proceeds to parse the next element in the file. This can result in a slow load time for your website. HTML4 introduced the defer and async attributes of the <script> element to address the user wait-time in the website based on different scenarios.

The defer attribute specifies scripts should be executed after the HTML file is completely parsed. When the HTML parser encounters a <script> element with the defer attribute, it loads the script but defers the actual execution of the JavaScript until after it finishes parsing the rest of the elements in the HTML file.

Here is an example of the defer tag:

<script src="example.js" defer></script> 
When is defer useful?

//When a script contains functionality that requires interaction with the DOM, the defer attribute is the way to go. This way, it ensures that the entire HTML file has been parsed before the script is executed.//
//Async attribute
The async attribute loads and executes the script asynchronously with the rest of the webpage. This means that, similar to the defer attribute, the HTML parser will continue parsing the rest of the HTML as the script is downloaded in the background. However, with the async attribute, the script will not wait until the entire page is parsed: it will execute immediately after it has been downloaded. Here is an example of the async tag:

<script src="example.js" async></script>
When is it useful?

async is useful for scripts that are independent of other scripts in order to function accordingly. Thus, if it does not matter exactly at which point the script file is executed, asynchronous loading is the most suitable option as it optimizes web page load time.//
